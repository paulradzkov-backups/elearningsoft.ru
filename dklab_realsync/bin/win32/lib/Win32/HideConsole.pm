=head1 NAME

Win32::HideConsole - Use this in GUI applications (Tk, Win32::GUI, etc.) to hide that annoying console window that appears at execution time.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use Tk;
	use Win32::HideConsole;
	
	hide_console;
	
	my $main_window = MainWindow->new();
	$main_window->Label(-text => 'A GUI app with the console hidden!',
						-font => 'arial 14')->pack(-side => 'top');
	$main_window->MainLoop();
	

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Uses some Win32::API commands to hide the annoying console window that accompanies GUI applications (Tk, Win32::GUI, etc.).

=head1 METHODS

Only a single exported method is provided:

=head2 hide_console;

Place this command near the beginning of your code (right after the "use" directives) to hide the console window.

=head1 NOTES

Credit goes to "jdporter" who posted this clever solution on PerlMonks. I just modified it a bit and put it in module form
for easy reusability.
