RSync utility is from cwRsync: http://www.itefix.no/cwrsync/
Perl is ActivePerl 5.10


1. Non-ASCII characters in Windows RealSync's installation path

Note that only the old cwRsync 3.1.0 could properly work with non-ASCII
characters in folder names if RealSync is installed in such folder!
Newer cwRsync 4.0+ is based on Cygwin DLL 1.7.1-1+ which is still very 
buggy (even if we correctly set LC_ALL environment variable).

So, if you update cwRsync to a newer version in this directory, and the 
path to this directory includes non-ASCII characters, rsync will probably 
not work.


2. Non-ASCII characters in replicated files/folders

If a source OS'es encoding differs from a destination OS'es encoding,
RealSync does not support non-ASCII characters in replicated filenames.
Reasons:

a) server rsync version 3.0+ (with --iconv support) is quite rare;
b) we need all Perl's iconv libraries (more than 2M).
